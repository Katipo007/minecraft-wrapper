# Overview #

Example Plugins are the older example plugins.  They are not necessarily
actively maintained, but should generally function and provide examples 
of how to write a wrapper plugin, as well as demostrate wrapper functions.

Although not free of errors, and very simply coded, these can be adapted
into more robust versions with additional work.  If you wish to improve
or add a new plugin, submit your pull request to the `submitted-plugins`
directory.
