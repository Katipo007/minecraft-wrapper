# 
-  addGroupPerm(self, groupname, permissionnode, value=True)

        Used to add a permission node to a group.

        :Args:
            :groupname: The name of the permission group.

            :permissionnode: The permission node to add to the group.
             The node can be another group!  Nested permissions must be
             enabled (see player api "hasPermission").

            :value: value of the node.  normally True to allow the
             permission, but can be false to deny the permission. For
             instance, you want a "badplayer" group to be denied some
             command that would normally be permitted.

        :returns:  string message indicating the outcome

        
-  blockForEvent(self, eventtype)

        Blocks until the specified event is called.
        
-  callEvent(self, event, payload, abortable=False)

        Invokes the specific event. Payload is extra information
        relating to the event. Errors may occur if you don't specify
        the right payload information.

        The only use it seems to have is internal (it is used by
        player.sendCommand().

        
-  checkPassword(self, password, hashed_password)

        Bcrypt-based password checker.  Takes a raw string password and
        compares it to the hash of a previously hashed password, returning True
        if the passwords match, or False if not.

        Bcrypt functions are to be used where ever you are storing a user's
        password, but do not ever want to be able to "know" their password
        directly.  We only need to know if the password they supplied is
        correct or not.

        :Args:
            :password: The raw string password to be checked.
            :hashed_password: a previously stored hash.

        :returns: Boolean result of the comparison.  Returns
         False if bcrypt is not installed on the system.
        
-  createGroup(self, groupname)

        Used to create a permission group.

        :Args:
            :groupname: The name of the permission group.


        :returns:  string message indicating the outcome

        
-  deleteGroup(self, groupname)

        Used to delete a permission group.

        :Args:
            :groupname: The name of the permission group.


        :returns:  string message indicating the outcome

        
-  deleteGroupPerm(self, groupname, permissionnode)

        Used to remove a permission node to a group.

        :Args:
            :groupname: The name of the permission group.

            :permissionnode: The permission node to remove.

        :returns:  string message indicating the outcome

        
-  getPluginContext(self, plugin_id)

        Returns the instance (content) of another running wrapper
        plugin with the specified ID.

        :arg plugin_id:  The `ID` of the plugin from the plugin's header.
         if no `ID` was specified by the plugin, then the file name
         (without the .py extension) is used as the `ID`.

        :sample usage:

            .. code:: python

                essentials_id = "com.benbaptist.plugins.essentials"
                running_essentials = api.getPluginContext(essentials_id)
                warps = running_essentials.data["warps"]
                print("Warps data currently being used by essentials: \n %s" %
                      warps)
            ..

        :returns:  Raises exception if the specified plugin does not exist.

        
-  getStorage(self, name, world=False, pickle=True)

        Returns a storage object manager for saving data between reboots.

        :Args:
            :name:  The name of the storage (on disk).
            :world:  THe location of the storage on disk -
                :False: '/wrapper-data/plugins'.
                :True: '<serverpath>/<worldname>/plugins'.
            :Pickle:  Whether wrapper should pickle or save as json.

            Pickle formatting is the default. pickling is
             less strict than json formats and leverages binary storage.
             Use of json can result in errors if your keys or data do not
             conform to json standards (like use of string keys).  However,
             pickle is not generally human-readable, whereas json is human
             readable.

        :Returns: A storage object manager.  The manager contains a
         storage dictionary called 'Data'. 'Data' contains the
         data your plugin will remember across reboots.
        ___

        :NOTE: This method is somewhat different from previous Wrapper
         versions prior to 0.10.1 (build 182).  The storage object is
         no longer a data object itself; It is a manager used for
         controlling the saving of the object data.  The actual data
         is contained in the property/dictionary variable 'Data'

        ___

        :sample methods:

            The new method:

            .. code:: python

                # to start a storage:
                self.homes = self.api.getStorage("homes", True)

                # access the data:
                for player in self.homes.Data:  # note upper case `D`
                    print("player %s has a home at: %s" % (
                        player, self.homes.Data[player]))

                # to save (storages also do periodic saves every minute):
                self.homes.save()

                # to close (and save):
                def onDisable(self):
                    self.homes.close()
            ..

            the key difference is here (under the old Storage API):

            .. code:: python

                # This used to work under the former API
                # however, this will produce an exception
                # because "self.homes" is no longer an
                # iterable data set:
                for player in self.homes:  <= Exception!
                    print("player %s has a home at: %s" % (
                        player, self.homes[player]))
            ..

            **tip**
            *to make the transition easier for existing code, redefine
            your the storage statements above like this to re-write as
            few lines as possible (and avoid problems with other
            plugins that might link to your plugin's data)*:

            .. code:: python

                # change your storage setup from:
                self.homes = self.api.getStorage("homes", True)

                # to:
                self.homestorage = self.api.getStorage("homes", True)
                self.homes = homestorage.Data

                # Now the only other change you need to make is to any
                # .save() or .close() statements:
                def onDisable(self):
                    # self.homes.close()  # change to -
                    self.homestorage.close()
            ..

        
-  hashPassword(self, password)

        Bcrypt-based password encryption.  Takes a raw string password
        returns a string representation of the binary hash.

        Bcrypt functions are to be used where ever you are storing a user's
        password, but do not ever want to be able to "know" their password
        directly.  We only need to know if the password they supplied is
        correct or not.

        :Args:
            :password: The raw string password to be encrypted.

        :returns: a string representation of the encrypted data.  Returns
         False if bcrypt is not installed on the system.

        
-  registerCommand(self, command, callback, permission=None)

        This registers a command that, when entered by the Minecraft
        client, will execute `callback(player, args)`. permission is
        an optional attribute if you want your command to only be
        executable if the player has a specified permission node.

        :Args:
            :command:  The command the client enters (without the
             slash).  using a slash will mean two slashes will have
             to be typed (e.g. "/region" means the user must type "//region".

            :callback:  The plugin method you want to call when the
             command is typed. Expected arguments that will be returned
             to your function will be: 1) the player  object, 2) a list
             of the arguments (words after the command, stripped of
             whitespace).

            :permission:  A string item of your choosing, such as
             "essentials.home".  Can be (type) None to require no
             permission.  (See also `api.registerPermission` for another
             way to set permission defaults.)

        :sample usage:

            .. code:: python

                self.api.registerCommand("home", self._home, None)
            ..

        :returns:  None/Nothing

        
-  registerEvent(self, eventname, callback)

        Register an event and a callback function. See
         https://github.com/benbaptist/minecraft-wrapper/blob/development/documentation/events.rst
         for a list of events.

        :Args:
            :eventname:  A text name from the list of built-in events,
             for example, "player.place".
            :callback: the plugin method you want to be called when the
             event occurs. The contents of the payload that is passed
             back to your method varies between events.

        :returns:  None/Nothing

        
-  registerHelp(self, groupname, summary, commands)

        Used to create a help group for the /help command.

        :Args:
            :groupname: The name of the help group (usually the plugin
             name). The groupname is the name you'll see in the list
             when you run '/help'.

            :summary: The text that you'll see next next to the help
             group's name.

            :commands: a list of tuples in the following example format;

                .. code:: python

                    [("/command <argument>, [optional_argument]", "description", "permission.node"),
                    ("/summon <EntityName> [x] [y] [z]", "Summons an entity", None),
                    ("/suicide", "Kills you - beware of losing your stuff!", "essentials.suicide")]
                ..

        :returns:  None/Nothing

        
-  registerPermission(self, permission=None, value=False)

        Used to set a default for a specific permission node.

        Note: *You do not need to run this function unless you want*
        *certain permission nodes to be granted by default.*
        *i.e., 'essentials.list' should be on by default, so players*
        *can run /list without having any permissions*

        :Args:
            :permission:  String argument for the permission node; e.g.
             "essentials.list"
            :value:  Set to True to make a permission default to True.

        :returns:  None/Nothing

        
-  resetGroups(self)

        resets group data (removes all permission groups).

        :returns:  nothing

        
-  resetUsers(self)

        resets all user data (removes all permissions from all users).

        :returns:  nothing

        
-  sendAlerts(self, message, group="wrapper", blocking=False)

        Used to send alerts outside of wrapper (email, for instance).

        :Args:
            :message: The message to be sent to the servers configured
             and listed in the wrapper.propertues ["Alerts"]["servers"]
             list.
            :group: message will be sent to each of the emails/servers
             listed that have the matching "group" in
             wrapper.properties.json["Alerts"]["servers"][<serverindex>]["group"]
            :blocking: if True, runs non-daemonized and holds up continued
             wrapper execution until sending is complete.  You would want this
             set to False normally when dealing with players.  However, at an
             'onDisable' plugin event, or anywhere else wrapper execution may end
             abruptly, blocking may be advisble to ensure the emails finish.

        :returns:  None/Nothing

        
-  sendEmail(self, message, recipients, subject, group="wrapper", blocking=False)

        Use group email server settings to email a specified set of recipients
        (independent of alerts settings or enablement).

        :Args:
            :message: The message content to be emailed (text/string).
            :recipients: list of email addresses, type=list (even if only one)
            :subject: plain text
            :group: message will be sent using the settings in the matching
             "group" in wrapper.properties.json["Alerts"]["servers"][<serverindex>]["group"]
            :blocking: if True, runs non-daemonized and holds up continued
             wrapper execution until sending is complete.  You would want this
             set to False normally when dealing with players.  However, at an
             'onDisable' plugin event, or anywhere else wrapper execution may end
             abruptly, blocking may be advisble to ensure the emails finish.

        :returns:  None/Nothing

        
-  wrapperHalt(self)

        Shuts wrapper down entirely.  To use this as a wrapper-restart
        method, use some code like this in a shell file to start
        wrapper (Linux example).  This code will restart wrapper
        after every shutdown until the console user ends it with CTRL-C.

        .. caution::
            (using CTRL-C will allow Wrapper.py to close gracefully,
            saving it's Storages, and shutting down plugins. Don't use
            CTRL-Z unless absolutely necessary!)
        ..

        :./start.sh:


            .. code:: bash

                    #! bin/bash
                    function finish() {
                      echo "Stopped startup script!"
                      read -p "Press [Enter] key to continue..."
                      exit
                    }

                    trap finish SIGINT SIGTERM SIGQUIT

                    while true; do
                      cd "/home/wrapper/"
                      python Wrapper.py
                      sleep 1
                    done
            ..
