Build 22 - fix #552, #553
 old player objects still found in player list (if player was kicked by wrapper).
 kick players who connect directly to an offline wrapper or server.

Build 21 - fix #551 - Minecraft commands don't get sent to server with playercommand interface

Build 20 - fix #554 - player login event in sub-worlds can happen too soon for proxy..

Build 19 - fix #550, #552:
 player remains connected to Hub world after player disconnects from child world.
 player object needs destruction after client keepalives abort.

Build 18 [1.0b18]
I had forgotten how effective writing and testing plugins was to determine the state of Wrapper's health...
------------------------------
- add documentation on packet usages and sending client packets.
- stage some changes to build script to add other modules to the docs (like clientconnection.py).
- small mods to the player API. try to standarize and make packet handling mode accessible to the plugin dev.
- Cleared these Example plugins as being pretty much still functional and I updated
   any needed updates to the modern API:
    - poll.py - appears to work. An antique!
    - WorldEdit - updated (and helpful to catch bugs in API.world).
    - zombie - needed some header items to get it working.
    - speedboost - works fine as is.
    - open.py - updated plugin to modern methods.  Untested, alpha plugin; but a
     good example of packet operations and client handling.
  Only essentials and SmallBrother need work now.
Just shoving my changes for now, before I fix more bugs:
 - colored lines lose color in the client after first line when using &/ยง codes inside a json chat object.
 - playerobject needs destruction when keepalives abort:
 - player is still logged into HUB when they disconnect their game from the child world.
 - (new error) - Minecraft commands are not getting passed down to the server after wrapper has finished parsing for it's own commands.
 - if the world is a child world, the client needs more time to spawn before officially letting the mcserver.py issue the "player.login" event.
 - fix for rogue players that inadvertently join a proxy world directly to the server's port.  Put them in adventure/spectator mode or something..


Build 17 [1.0b17]
- Touch up plugins some.
- Fix bugs in Event code.  Standardize event process:
    Plugin returns   ==   event returns
    False            ==   False
    None/True        ==   True
    Payload          ==   Payload
    Multiple plugins can modify the final event return:
    Any plugin can permanently Abort the Event.  Any False is permanent.
    Any plugin can None/True, but a subsequent event can False or payload it (mod it)
    Any plugin can return a payload _if_ it has not been `False`d..
- Fix Chat.py and move to Stable-Plugins.
- Make player creation and destruction more consistent.  Players are created
 at wrapper login and destroyed only at logoff (from wrapper, not the server!)
- Clarify that the only uuid that is a string and not MCUUID is player
 property 'uuid'.


Build 16 [1.0b16]
- Make player respawn to hub if destination connection fails:
    - If server is full
    - If server is offline
- stage a skin for later use (so we don't need to download a mission one)


Build 15 [1.0b15]
- Lots of little bug fixes and cleanup.
- Changed API for player connect back to connect(ip, port) (ordered arguments change)
- Updated the plugins for new API.
- Implemented "max-players" into proxy (a separate thing from the server's max players).


Build 14 [1.0b14]
- Correct error that caused wrapper to restart twice when a new config section was added.
- Continued improvements to UUID reliability
- create a player.uuid property that reliably returns the very best (online)
 UUID it can find.  This uuid is used to positively ID a player for purposes
 of uniquely identifying that player no matter what name they have.
- Finished player.connect() function.
- Include sample hubworlds plugin in examples and Stable plugins.
- Correct bugs in inventory packet set_slot handling.
- Correct bugs in SLOT reading and sending.
- removed last of packet.send and packet.read deprecated methods, which will not be in the release.


Build 13 [1.0b13]
Create wrapper channel plugin message system for sharing info between online and offline wrappers.

Basic handshake:
----------------
SETUP:
```
(Minecraft server [SECOND_WORLD]) <--offline--> WrapperServer[SECOND_WORLD] <--offline--> WrapperClient[HUB_WORLD] <--`session-server`--> Minecraft client
                                                                                                    |
                                                          (Minecraft server [HUB_WORLD]) <--offline--
```
PROCESS:
WrapperServer <===PING<=== WrapperClient
WrapperServer ===>(self.client.info)PONG===> WrapperClient
WrapperServer <===RESP(self.client.info)<=== WrapperClient

After the third step

Details:
----------------
1) Client wrapper (serverconnection.py) - initiates a WRAPPER.PY|PING (SB) after the player logs in.
2) Server wrapper (clientconnection.py) - Notes that its "client-is-wrapper" = True
3) Server wrapper - sends back a WRAPPER.PY|PONG (CB) containing it's `self.info` dictionary.
4) Client wrapper - sends back a WRAPPER.PY|PONG (SB) containing _it's_ `self.client.info` dictionary (the one with accurate user info).
5) Client wrapper - Notes that its "server-is-wrapper" = True
6) Server wrapper - takes note of the client's IP, username, and UUID.

```
class Client(object):
    def __init__(self, proxy, clientsock, client_addr, banned=False):
    ...
    self.info = {
        "username": "",
        "uuid": "",
        "ip": "",
        "client-is-wrapper": False,
        "server-is-wrapper": False
    }
```

These plugin messages will help wrapper determine it's role (HUB or subworld),
pass server information, manage login/logouts, pass proper online UUIDs to
plugins even if the plugin's (local) wrapper is offline.


Build 12 [1.0b12]
Started as a refactor, but I discovered that Entity controls were not functioning properly.
 (and discovered that the mineraft entity controls actually are not as robust as ours).
- Refactored all packet constants to a standard format:
    CONSTANT = [PACKET, [PARSING]], where PACKET = 0xNN packet number and parsing
     is a list of constants like [VARINT, BOOL, STRING].  Some packets already
     followed this convention, but most simply defined packets like `PACKET_NAME = 0xNN`
- Correct errors with new mcserver.py `_console_event` function not sending commands anywhere
 except for the wrapper interface.
- Corrected Entities config items listing old names (i.e. - 'Sheep' was changed to 'sheep' in 11.1)
- Added internal wrapper event 'server.autoCompletes' to process (future) autocompletions.
- Added optimization to make non-abortable events spur off in their own thread to prevent
 delays to wrapper (and in proxy mode, proxy packet) processing.
- Removed "player.runCommand" event from public API.  It is now private event.  Also
 changed the behaviour to not be "abortable".. I.e. any command _will_ abort and get
 processed directly by _either_ wrapper or the server.
- All registered commands run on their own thread, so wrapper plugin commands
 do not pause proxy!
- All non-abortable events run as a deamon thread, allowing wrapper to continue
 running while any event runs on a separate thread.
- Made improvements to whitelist commands `online` and `offline`.


Build 11 [1.0b11]
- scrub out old packet.send methods that will be deprecated.
- clean up keep-alives a little.


Build 10 [1.0b10]
- correct compression bugs where client and server could be at different compression numbers.
 _They must be operating at the same compression level now_ because of the "once-only compression"
 used by proxymode now.
- correct bug that was escaping backslash as %5C in web (MOTD).
- refactoring of proxymode's uuid usages again.  Still trying to improve UUID handling to minimize
 incorrect and False/None uuid issues.
- Improved name change handling.  Name changes are now truly automatic.  If you don't want automatic
 name change handling, set config `["Proxy"]["auto-name-changes"] = False` and wrapper will use the
 old "falling back to..." name behavior.  If you are supporting (vanilla server) local aliases via
 a plugin, you should set this to False.
- Improve proxy to only use compression once (while reading a packet).  If a packet
 is not going to be changed, the original unmolested packet is resent, eliminating
 the need to re-compress.

Build 9  [1.0b9]
- Critical bugfix for anyone using "BetterConsole" mode.


Build 8  [1.0b8]
-Improve web to get player.message() - see build 1.0b4, third bullet point.
- Console readouts are redirected to the player who ran the command (benefits Web).
- Improve Web Chat and Console layouts.
- Allow login page to capture a unique username for the WebAdmin.


Build 7  [1.0b7]
- Whitelist online/offline also converts player data uuid files to their correct type, so converting
 the server between online and offline will not hurt players inventory (provided you restart promptly).
- Code staged so that name changes can incorporate the same abilities to transfer UUID information


Build 6  [1.0b6]
FIX Whitelisting!  #314
- whitelist add/remove both also 'reload'... because everybody forgets that part!
- whitelist adds players using offline uuids while in proxy mode.
- two new commands added:
    - /whitelist online - convert all whitelist names to online uuids (to set server to online mode)
    - /whitelist offline -  convert all whitelist names to offline uuids (to set server to offline/proxy mode)
- uuid changes are "cosmetic" and do not affect player inventory, etc.  HOWEVER; changing a servers online mode WILL.


Build 5  [1.0b5]
- [#519](https://github.com/benbaptist/minecraft-wrapper/issues/519) - delay server backups during idle periods.


Build 4 [1.0b4]
- upgrade consoleuser.py for use with new player.message()
- add its 'execute()' method.
- create support for alternate output streams besides the console.
- more proxy fixes as I prepare to fix whitelisting issues:
    - Made disconnects work better and staged ability to allow proxy client
     to ignore proxy server disconnects (later on for lobby/multiserver ops)
    - Disconnect messages use minecraft translate and work in all client states.
    - Added way to substitute coloration and augmented text for commands wrapper
     modifies (in this case, 'op') - parse_cb.py.
    - added a 'client_notify()' function to let server request a client's
     disconnection.  Client will have the abilty to ignore this request! :D
- install vanilla whitelist commands into 'commands.py' -off, on, add, remove, list, reload
- Manually Save server before a restart (spigot plugins mess with save states).
- Fix bug in commands.command_op that would op "False" player if name is left blank.


Build 3 [1.0b3]
- Fix in-game "wrapper update" command (was broken with new version format)


Build 2 [1.0b2]
- Ensure server auto-restarts don't happen during a backup cycle.
- added some API.backups functions to test backup status.
- Fix [#521](https://github.com/benbaptist/minecraft-wrapper/issues/521)
   using a config item in Misc: "trap-ctrl-z"
- reverted "properly implement Ctrl-z as a wrapper/server 'freeze'." in favor of the above solution.
- removed option to disable wrapper passphrase.
- fixed player.message broken with regards to '&' usages.  Also works for
  all json again, including "translate".
- Player.message takes second argument for position of message (0,1,2)


Build 266 / Build 1 [1.0.0  beta]
- properly implement Ctrl-z as a wrapper/server 'freeze' (does not work).
- restage version.py and make buildscript.py comply with 5 part format.
- build numbers are now unique only to major version and release type (X.x.x, 'a','b', 'rc', 'final')


Build 265 [0.16.1]
- remove PyCrypto dependency!  PyCrypto is no longer maintained.
 PyCrypto was not pip installing properly anymore on recent Python3
 systems.  This was the straw that broke the camel's back.  It has
 fork that is being maintained (pycryptodome), but we already have a good
 crypto package requirement in use for wrapper encryption (cryptography),
 so I chose to leverage that instead to minimize the number of
 package dependencies:
- wrapper dependencies are only `requests`, `cryptography` and `bcrypt`:
 `package_resources` is part of normal setuptools on any recent pip version these days.
- added file "requirements.txt" to be useful for `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Build 264 [0.16.0] The web version.
- Web console commands pass through wrappers console parsing, so that wrapper
 commands can be run in Web.
- Add Wrapper memory usage items to Web.
- touch-up server.properties layout.
- fix player chat in Web mode.
- remove debug code console logs from web code.
- Py3 fixes for Web mode.

Build 263b [0.16.0] The web version.  (not pulled to benBaptist Dev)
- documentation touch-ups
- change check_password and hash_password (new functions) to checkPassword and
 hashPassword for API consistency.
- clean up management/html/request.js code up.
- Fixed key/session-key/sessionKey components throughout web.py, login.html, and admin.html.
- Fixed admin.html tick and statsCallback functions to get web page data to refresh properly
- Fixed up logins code some more to ensure
- Repair various stats in code.  Added free disk space stat (only works for py3).
- Move "server.consoleMessage" event code out of javaserver.py and into wrapper.py.
- make server 'restart' call start if server is stopped (versus telling user to run /start...
- Move ServerVitals class out of javaserver.py into it's own module servervitals.py
 because I keep forgetting where the class is...
- make wrapper override console /kick command because, if proxymode, it must be done with
 client.disconnect, not the console kick (which will leave the client hanging
 until it times out and will not display the kick message).
- Fix Web components:
    - Console
    - Files - New Directory working
    - Server properties - can be saved and reloaded.
    - plugins - can be disabled.  If all plugins are disabled, all disabled plugins can be reloaded.
    - Kick and ban options in player list fixed and work properly, depending on proxy mode.
    - playercounts read (x / n) (i.e. 5/20 or 1/20, etc) not "undefined/undefined"
 Only things left now to get a full working web mode:
  - [ ] get chat panel working
  - [ ] OP and DeOP buttons in playerlist (should "op" be there?)

Build 263
- Finally repaired logins; fixed isAuthed() components of login.html and admin.html
- tested OK with firefox and chrome browsers.
- Fixed bug that prevented browsing into directories with periods (like com.banbaptist.some.plugin)
- retaining the feature for using 'safe-ips'.
- Moved out alot of cruft that probably was/is experimental, unused, or meant for the new
 management.py interface.  Proposed items for removal are in `/management/html/html_deprecate`. Extra
 js, css, and junk... just lots of clutter to confuse us.

Build 262
- First working Web module, with important changes:
    - Best results with Firefox.
    - Password login is NOT WORKING
    - only connections from localhost are allowed by default.
    - To access web from another network (IP), in the config:
        1) Add the ip to "Web" config item 'safe-ips"
        2) Set item 'use_safe_ips' to true.
    - Basic buttons work (reload plugins, halt wrapper, start/stop/restart/kill server)
    - file operations fully functional (in Firefox only)!
    - Chat and console "send" things, but don't "receive" responses
__Future__
 We are also using (seem forced to) deprecated Synchronous XMLHttpRequest
 (setting False to third argument in `XMLHttpRequest.open()`  Tried to
 use True a few different ways, but it still breaks our ability to get
 a good textResponse from XMLHttpRequest.

 Right now, though, it is functional enough to do some nice RC stuff, like
 renaming and deleting files!  So, I am making it an official build for
 development!

Build 261
- Add api.base item sendEmail( message, recipients, subject, group="wrapper") to api.
- Make alerts have a threaded interface to allow non-blocking alert processing.
- Built-in alerts for wrapper startup, shutdown, and crashes.

Build 260
- Finish alerts API.  Alerts allow wrapper to send emails:
    - api.base - sendAlerts(self, message, group="wrapper")
    - New wrapper.properties.json section:
    ```json

    ...
    {
      "Alerts": {
        "enabled": false, <-- don't enable this until after a correct password has been entered.
        "password-plaintext": false, <-- 1) Enter a password in place of false... start wrapper and it will be encrypted and placed in "password"
        "password": "", <-- 2) cut this and paste it below in "encrypted-password"
        "servers": [
          {
            "group": "wrapper",
            "subject": "Wrapper.py Alert",
            "address": "smtp-mail.outlook.com",
            "encrypted-password": "Copy and Paste from 'password' (above) after wrapper encrypts it.",
            "login-name": "myliveaccount@live.com", <-- This is the email account that will send the emails.
            "port": 587,
            "recipients": [
              "someone@gmail.com",
              "someone-else@yahoo.com"
            ],
            "type": "email"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ...
    ```
- Correct concern with Wrapper console echoing commands when setting passwords.
 the echoed and logged password is in plain text as the user typed it. [#513](https://github.com/benbaptist/minecraft-wrapper/issues/513)
- Web mode still broken.

Build 259 (and 258)
- first crack at getting web.py working (i.e., at least getting into the admin page).
- Web mode changed for now to only permit bindings to 127.0.0.1 because:
- password checking is disabled in admin.html (function isAuthed()).
- Warning messages in wrapper startup.
- Warning messages in Login.html.

Build 257
- Add countdown timers of 45, 30, 15 and then 5-1 seconds to the reboot timers broadcasts
- Add a backups summary text.

Build 256 [0.15.1]
- fix spigot bug where nicknamed players producing chat results in
 an invalid playerobject being generated with a player.message event
 because the nickname is not a logged on player.
- will wait for first release candidate to reset build numbers..
- A few documentation updates/corrections.
- update change logs (not done properly since 0.7.7)

Starting with:
Build 255 [0.15.0] - Developement branch update
